As I write this review in November 2021, I have the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) radio playing. The show Ontario Today is airing a special edition because British Columbia (BC) is working to declare a state of emergency in the wake of devastating flooding & mudslides, due to multiple reasons including a weather condition called an “atmospheric river” – a title which, although sounding apocalyptic, does not even do justice to the disaster meted out on the people of the province. Major infrastructure has been destroyed including highways & bridges. Thousands of farm animals have drowned or are without food. Supply chains have been disrupted. Thousands of residents have been evacuated from towns. Many more are stranded or cut off from essential services. Note that this is not a part of the world in which monsoons or flooding have been remotely common in past millennia.
However, this is not the only extreme climate that BC has suffered recently: a “heat dome” bringing summer temperatures in the mid-forties centigrade (~110 F), & in its wake, devastating forest fires. 
A caller is being asked what advice he can offer Canadians outside of BC regarding extreme climate events. 

“Get ready!” the caller says.

This reviewer cannot think of any better way to “get ready”, than to read RiskThinking, in which we are provided with a "risk-thinking" lens through which to tackle humankind’s greatest challenges to survive in a fast-changing world of radical uncertainty.

Ron Dembo has written a terse, engaging book with the essential theme of humility. Whilst Dembo has huge respect for statistics & probability, he urges us to be modest & to tame our swagger as to their effectiveness to assess & ameliorate risk, especially in situations of radical uncertainty.

His message is not defeatist. Far from it, Dembo provides us with the tools to describe & strategize against risk, namely intelligent scenario analysis & hedging. However, those tools will fail us, he cautions us, if we permit forecasting & stochastic control approaches to seduce us into a false sense of security.

Dembo is not anti-expert. Far from it, his analytical toolkit advocates the “maximal use of forward-looking data & expert opinion to make strategic assessments of inherently uncertain future developments”, as David Dodge, former governor of the Bank of Canada explains in his praise.

In Chapter 2 we learn that experts are essential, but to which should we go for opinions? In a most satisfying section on “Who counts as an expert?” Dembo shares a scathing criticism of the problematic attempts of the Nobel laureate William Nordhaus to integrate climate modelling into long run macroeconomic analysis. 

Nordhaus, too, believes in gathering viewpoints on the economic impact of climate change, but is guilty of favouring economists & social scientists over climate scientists; ultimately he excludes all views of non-economists in his work in his Dynamic Integrated Climate Change (DICE) model. 

Pulling no punches, the absurdity of Nordhaus’s arguments was presented by economist Steve Keen at the OECD Conference “Averting Systemic Collapse” in Paris in 2019. Dembo talks us through the challenges of reducing bias and selecting truly expert experts. On Nordhaus, he quotes Keen: “These claims are not just ‘useless’, they’re worse than useless – they’ve distracted us from the important challenge we face.” 

Dembo illustrates his thesis with many engaging examples large & small, including the Covid pandemic, driving at night, Commander Chris Hadfield’s epic spacewalk when blinded, a personal anecdote about his dangerous passion for free diving, urban planning, cash flow management in a startup, autonomous cars, Angela Merkel’s political challenges with nuclear power and countless others.

However, one does not need to read between the lines to realize that there is one key risk management challenge that is motivating Dembo throughout the book: the climate crisis. That example comes to the fore in Chapter 8, when he spells it out: “climate change is probably the most complex & serious problem we have faced as a species”. 

He states his goal: to design “a top-down, science-based, data-driven, scalable, and repeatable approach to creating standards and software for measuring and managing climate-related financial risk. Organizations should be able to take nonfinancial scenarios involving physical risks such as drought, flooding, and other manifestations of climate change & convert them into financial variables that affect their businesses.”

There are many that condemn models because they don’t have a scientific background themselves & are threatened by what they do not understand. This is not Dembo - his beef with models comes from the opposite end of the quantitative ability spectrum. He is no slouch when it comes to applied mathematics. Dembo holds a PhD in Operations Research & was a professor at Yale University. The tools created by his highly successful financial risk software company, Algorithmics, were & continue to be essential to financial institutions around the world because they are based on pragmatic, science-based, best-practice risk management ideas & models.

Financial markets have their own elements of radical uncertainty, but typically the time horizons are measured in months not decades, &, times of crisis aside, a reasonable portion of uncertainty is measurable using the tools of statistics & probability. (For a critical perspective on industry-standard financial risk measures such as Value at Risk see Riccardo Rebonato’s Plight of the Fortune Tellers: Why We Need to Manage Financial Risk Differently (2010). Nassim Taleb’s Incerto series including Fooled by Randomness (2005) & The Black Swan (2007) explore similar themes.).

However, when dealing with the climate crisis Dembo implores us to act with less hubris. In that hybrid system, we must deal with a multitude of interactions between two fiendishly complex, hard-to-model & non-linear systems, even individually: the climate system, consisting of the atmosphere, the oceans, the land & the biosphere; and the global economy. (At least in the former there is consensus on the best way to proceed at least in principle. There are not “schools” in climate science as there are in economics.)

To understand where RiskThinking falls in the panoply of books that explore the deficiencies of standard risk management practice, a good explanation is provided by the Canadian astronaut Commander Chris Hadfield in his preface to the book:

“Humans are remarkable toolmakers… We can also often predict the future and thus influence it. Our imaginations allow us to see the many ways that events might unfold and then take actions to get the results we want… This book is the crossover between those two ideas: predicting the future and harnessing tools.”

Dembo’s book is the latest in a series of great books on the topic of radical uncertainty & how best to manage it. John Kay and Mervyn King's Radical Uncertainty (2020) explains that in economics radical uncertainty is usually associated with the work of John Maynard Keynes & Frank Knight in the early part of the last century. Dembo also cites Margaret Heffernan's Uncharted (2020), & Jens Beckert and Richard Bronk's collection of essays, Uncertain Futures (2018), as inspirations for his treatment of this topic. 

Richard Bookstaber’s End of Theory (2017) criticizes the standard economic model for its inability to adequately describe financial crises because of the complexities of financial systems. Bookstaber lists radical uncertainty, along with computational irreducibility, emergent phenomena, non-ergodicity as his “Four Horsemen of the Econopalypse” – characteristics of the real world (in the case of climate modeling) & human behaviour (in the case of economics) that motivate a shift from mainstream rational expectations equilibrium models towards agent-based models. 

What sets RiskThinking apart from these excellent books is the clarity & pragmatism of Dembo’s fundamentally upbeat message. “Humans are successful because they have adapted to an environment that they understand only imperfectly. Throughout history, we have developed a variety of ways of coping with the uncertainty that defines our lives. We stockpile, insure, anticipate – we are hyper-anxious animals with a level of realism that has a high survival value… And so, we are survivors – natural-born risk thinkers.” 

So long as we are willing to call out that the emperor has no clothes when confronted with certain forecasting models, & to not let our reverence for such models cloud our instincts, we will be in a position to make good decisions, even in the face of radical uncertainty, & even when the primary challenge - the climate crisis -  is the greatest challenge yet against which the human race has pitted its wits.

The lesson starts right here: consider a scenario under which you are required to risk think, but you don’t know how. Dembo provides the hedge.

I highly recommend RiskThinking, the sanest book on decision making that I have ever read.
